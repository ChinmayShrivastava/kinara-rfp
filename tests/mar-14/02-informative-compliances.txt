INFORMATIVE: The technical approach of the proposal will be evaluated based on the SOW, and ratings such as High Confidence, Some Confidence, or Low Confidence will be assigned. High Confidence means the Government has high confidence in the Offeror's understanding and approach, while Some Confidence and Low Confidence indicate varying levels of confidence with some or little Government intervention needed for successful contract performance.

INFORMATIVE: The past performance evaluation will consider the Offeror's demonstrated record of performance in providing services that meet customer needs during the past five years. The relevancy between past performance and solicitation requirements will be evaluated based on similarity in size, scope, and complexity.
INFORMATIVE: Lack of comparable and relevant past performance information will result in a neutral rating.
INFORMATIVE: If past performance as a subcontractor is submitted, relevancy will be evaluated based on the work done under the subcontract, not the entire scope of work as performed by the prime contractor.
INFORMATIVE: The Government will review records contained in the CPARS assessing the likelihood that an Offeror can successfully perform the required work. The Government reserves the right to contact and use information provided by the references available in CPARS while conducting past performance evaluations.
INFORMATIVE: A "Neutral" rating in Factor 3 will be considered "Awardable" and is assigned to Offerors without relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available. This indicates the contractor has little or no recent/relevant past performance upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction.
INFORMATIVE: The proposed rates will be incorporated into the final IDIQ award and be utilized in the associated task orders.
INFORMATIVE: The Government intends to make an award without communications but preserves the right to do so if necessary. Decision to award or not will be made by applying the factor ratings and price evaluation, consistent with the method stated in Section 4.
INFORMATIVE: Desired outcomes, performance standards, monitoring methods, and incentive/disincentive details are provided for each service requirement, outlining compliance standards and consequences for non-compliance.
