FAR Part 15, and specifically \\nsource selection procedures at FAR  Subpart  15.3 , do not apply  to evaluation of quotations and \\nwill not be used.  \\n \\nThe Government will award  the contract  to the quoter  that represents the overall best value to \\nmeet the Government’s needs. Best Value is defined as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government’s estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement, in accordance with FAR 2.101. The Government intends to determine the best value outcome by utilizing a Tradeoff Process to consider making award to other than the lowest \\nprice or other than the highest technically r ated quoter . \\n THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ISSUE AWARD WITHOUT ENGAGING IN \\nEXCHANGES  WITH VENDORS, BUT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DO SO,  AS \\nNECESSARY.  \\n \\nConsequently, quoters  are encouraged to provide their best quote with initial submissions. \\nHowever, the Governme nt reserves the right to conduct discussions , orally or in writing, with \\nquoters  submitting  a quote if it is determined advantageous to the Government to do so. The \\nGovernment reserves the right to seek clarifications of  minor technical or administrative e rrors ; \\nhowever , these clarifications will not result in an opportunity to resubmit a  quote.  \\n Note  1: The Government will conduct an initial review of quotes  for completeness following the \\nclose of the RFQ  prior to conducting the full evaluation  described in this section . Quotes  that fail \\nto adhere to the submission guidelines in section 3 of the RFQ (e.g. missing volumes/sections, \\nrequired plans, documentation, pricing, etc.) may be eliminated from further consideration  (See \\nsections 3.0.4 and 4.2.2) or further evaluated. If a quotation is eliminated during this review, the \\nofferor will be notified in writing.  \\n Note 2 : Sustainable Acquisition Requirements : In accordance with HHSAR Part 323.701 \\nApplicability, there are no opportunities to acquire sustainable acquisition supplies or services in this procurement. This requirement solely pertains to Professional Services, specifically CLM S \\nservices. None of the components of this acquisition align with the descriptions provided in HHSAR part 323.7101. Consequently, there is no evaluation of a Sustainable Acquisition Plan \\nincluded this solicitation.  \\n \\n4.2 Evaluation  Factors  \\n The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  \\n \\nFactor 1: Technical Capability/Risk (non -price)  \\nFactor 2: Past Performance (non -price)  \\nFactor 3 : Price  \\n \\nFactor 1, Technical Capability/Risk is more important than Factor 2 - Past Performance. Factor ',\n",
       " 'SOLICITATION NUMBER 75N992-24-Q -00001  \\nPage 29 of 42  \\n1- Technical Capability/Risk and Factor 2-  Past Performance when combined are more \\nimportant than Factor 3- Price.  When proposals result in equal ratings for  Factor 1 -Technical \\nCapability/Risk and Factor 2- Past Performance, Factor 3- Price will have a more significant \\ninfluence  on overall value.  \\n \\nVendor s must achieve a rating of Technically Acceptable or high er and have a Past Performance rating \\nof at least Neutral Confidence  to be considered for award.  \\n \\n4.2.1 Best Value - Trade -Off Evaluation  \\n \\nThe Government will consider features of a quoter ’s total solution, including the quoter ’s \\nassumptions that could significantly impact the Government’s costs in implementing and \\nmaintaining the quoter ’s approach. As part of a quote, in response to the PWS, quoters  are required \\nto identify any assumptions that may impact price. The quote must be  complete, clear , and \\ncompliant with the terms of the RFQ.  \\n Award will be made to the quoter  whose quote is determined to provide the “best value” to the \\nGovernment. Thi s process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non -cost factors and allows the \\nGovernment to award to other than the lowest priced quote based  on evaluated benefits of the \\nofferor’s technical approach.  The best value will be determined by comparing evaluation results  of \\nnon-price factors with differences in evaluated prices (i.e., trade offs).  \\n \\nIn the event quoters  submit more than one approach to the agency’s requirement, each will be \\nevaluated independently  and assigned its own technical rating and evaluated price . The source selection \\nwill be made based on the approach that offers the best value to the Government in accordance with the criteria stated in section 4.   \\n4.2.2 Evaluation of Factor 1: Technical  Capability/Risk  \\n \\nThe Government will evaluate quoter ’s ability to deliver the specified requirements of the PWS , \\nas evidenced by its proposed plan for overall implementation and execution of  the following : \\n Note: The below three sections are not sub- factors. The information has been formatted this \\nway solely for the conv enience  of aligning with the Instructions to the Quotation in RFQ s ection \\n3. The Government will evaluate  Factor 1 Technical  Capability/Risk holistically, considering \\neach of these sections equally and aligning with the evaluation methodology described below .  \\n \\nSection 1 -Employee Development and Career Management Support  \\n  \\nCareer Development and Counseling Plan (CDCP)  \\n The quote will be evaluated on the thoroughness and comprehensiveness of the CDCP  based \\non the requirements detailed in PWS section 2.3.1. The quote will be evaluated on the proposed methods for conducting and utilizing mid- point assessments and stakeholder surveys \\nto track developmental progress and identify areas for improvement as detailed in PWS section 2.3.1.2.

Key Definitions:  \\n Weakness:  a flaw in the quote  that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  \\n Significant Weakness : a flaw in the quote that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract \\nperformance.  Deficiency:  a material failure of a quote  to m eet a Government requirement or a combination of \\nsignificant weaknesses in a quote  that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an \\nunacceptable level.  \\n Strength:  an aspect of an offeror ’s quote  with merit or will exceed specified perform ance or capability \\nrequirements to the advantage of the Government during contract performance.  \\n Note: Strengths may include, but are not limited to, quote  elements which meet the “highly desirable” \\nperformance characteristics identified in the PWS.  \\n \\n4.2.3 Evaluation of Factor 2: Past Performance  \\n The Past Performance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in a Vendor ’s ability to perform services that successfully meet users’ needs, based on a \\ndemonstrated record of per formance. The recency, relevancy (including context of the data), \\nand quality (including general trends on Vendor  performance and source of the information)  \\nshall be considered in evaluating this factor. These considerations will result in one (1) performa nce confidence assessment rating for each Vendor, as detailed herein.  \\n Recency is defined as (i) having been completed, or (ii) having been in progress and at least 25% completed based on the period of performance, at any point in the last three (3) years from the quote due date of this RFQ. The Government will determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the Vendor  is to this requirement.  ',\n",

This includes but is not limited to  the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS); past \\nperformance questionnaires; past and present customers and their employees, and any others who may have useful information; the Vendor ’s past performance under other federal  contracts.  \\n Vendor  Past Performance references  provided in Volume 2 of the vendor’s proposal will not be  \\ncompared directly to the past performance of other vendors.
