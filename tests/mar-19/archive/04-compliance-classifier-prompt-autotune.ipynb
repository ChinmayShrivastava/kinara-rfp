Assign a label of 0 to a compliance item if it is critical, mandatory, or directly impacts the application's functionality. This could be a hard requirement, soft requirement, or an explicitly defined requirement. Label it as 1 if it is optional, meaning it is not necessary but could enhance the application or is applicable in certain cases. Phrases like \"if applicable\" or \"upon request\" often indicate optional items. Assign -1 if the item is not a compliance requirement or if it is a duplicate of an item already listed. Be mindful of the context, implications, and nuances of the compliance items to accurately classify them. Pay attention to edge cases, such as duplicate items or items that may seem critical but are actually optional based on their implications."
