Reg. 17846, March 31, 2011) and the guidance provided in the “ DOE  Merit Review Guide for Financial Assistance,” effective \\nSeptem ber 2020, which is available at:  \\nhttps://energy.gov/management/downloads/merit- review -guide-financial-\\nassistance -and-unsolici ted-proposals-current. \\nC. Other Selection Factors  \\n \\ni. Program Policy Factors  \\nIn addition to the above criteria, the Selection Official may consider the following program policy factors in determining which Full Applications to  select for award \\nnegotiations:  \\n• The degree to which the proposed project exhibits technological diversity \\nwhen compared to the existing DOE project portfolio and other projects selected from the subject FOA ; \\n• The degree to which the proposed project, including proposed cost share, optimizes the use of available DO E funding to achieve programmatic \\nobjectives; \\n• The level of industry involvement and demonstrated ability to accelerate demonstration and commercialization and overcome key market barriers;  \\n• The degree to which the proposed project is likely to lead to increased high-\\nquality employment and manufacturing in the United States ; \\n• The degree to which the proposed project will accelerate transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty;  \\n• The degree to which the proposed project, or group of projects, represent a \\ndesired geographic distribution (considering past awards and current application s); \\n• The degre e to which the proposed project incorporates applicant or team \\nmembers from Minority Serving Institutions (e.g., Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)/Other Minority Institutions  (OMIs) ); and \\npartnerships with Minority Business Enterprises, minority-owned businesses, woman -owned businesses, veteran -owned businesses, or Indian trib es;  \\n• The degree to which the proposed project, when compared to the existing DOE project portfolio and other projects to be selected from the subject FOA, contributes to the total portfolio meeting the goals reflected in the \\nCommunity Benefits Plan criteria; ',\n",

Evaluation and Selection Process \\n \\ni. Overview  \\nThe evaluation process consists of multiple phases; each includes an initial \\neligibility review and a thorough technical review. Rigorous technical reviews of eligible submissions are conducted by reviewers that are experts in  the subject \\nmatter of the FOA. Ultimately, the Selection Official considers the recommendations of the reviewers, along with other considerations such as \\nprogram policy factors  and risk assessments, in determining which applications \\nto select.  \\n \\nii. Pre- Selec tion Clarification  \\nDOE may determine that pre -selection clarifications are necessary from one or \\nmore applicants. Pre -selection clarifications are distinct from and less formal \\nthan pre -selection interviews.  These pre -selection clarifications will solely be for \\nthe purposes of clarifying the application. The pre -selection clarifications may \\noccur before, during or after the merit review evaluation proce ss. Information \\nprovided by an applicant that is not necessary to address the pre -selection \\nclarification question will not be reviewed or considered. Typically, a pre -\\nselection clarification will be carried out through either written responses to \\nDOE’s written clarification questions or video or conference calls  with DO E \\nrepresentatives.
